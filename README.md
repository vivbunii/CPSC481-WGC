# Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem Solver
## Description
This program is a Python solution to the classic Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage problem. The code uses uninformed search algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), to find a solution to the problem, if one exists.

## Problem Statement
A farmer wants to cross a river, taking a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage with him. The boat that he uses can only carry two entities (including the farmer) at a time. There are constraints such as:

If the wolf and the goat are left alone (either on the initial side or the other side of the river), the wolf will eat the goat.
If the goat and the cabbage are left alone, the goat will eat the cabbage.
The objective is to have a plan to take all three items across the river without any of them being eaten.

## Dependencies
The search.py library is essential for the successful execution of this code, containing necessary search algorithms and data structures.

## How to Run
To execute the program, simply run the wolf_goat_cabbage.py file:

bash
Copy code
python3 wolf_goat_cabbage.py
## Output
The program will output the steps of the solution, indicating the transitions from one side of the river to the other, following the rules of the problem. The output will display the steps for both the DFS and BFS algorithms. If there's no solution found, it will indicate so.
